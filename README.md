Lego DB will be a database platform of every Lego set that exists. It will have every sets release date, price, pieces, etc. Users on the platform will be able to mark which sets they want to buy, have purchased, are building, have built, and leave a reviews on sets they have built with a star rating, this rating will then be displayed as an average between all users. It will also include the standard filters and search features any other traditional review platform (ex letterbox) would have.
