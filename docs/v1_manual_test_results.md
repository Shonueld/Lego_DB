# Example Flow 2 â€“ Builder Reviews a Completed Set
 
Alex just finished building the massive Millennium Falcon set and wants to document his experience and help other builders.

1. He starts by calling PUT /lists/alex456/sets/1 to mark the set as "built."
2. Then, he calls POST /sets/1/reviews to leave a 5-star review with a comment about how detailed and enjoyable the build was.
3. Noticing that a brick was missing from one of the bags, he also calls POST /sets/1/issues to report a known issue about the missing piece in bag 3.
4. He also wants to see if others had any issues, so he calls GET /sets/1/issues to see any other issues users may have had
